            <p> Hello! My name is Sophie Kedrowski. I'm from Minneapolis, MN. I'm currently working as registered nurse in an observation unit.
              I decided to try out full stack development in order to make a career change. When i'm not studying coding or working, I am an avid rock climber
              and you will find me at the climbing gym at least 6 days a week. Check out my portofolio to see some of the latest projects I have been working on.
            </p>
